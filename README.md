# Context 
In France and abroad, more and more consumers have become accustomed to using credit cards to make in particular their consumer purchases (supermarket, health expenses ...). 
The main financial institutions have understood this since the competition between them involves in particular the increase in the number of bank card holders associated 
with a revolving line of credit. But with the crisis, the default rate on outstanding loans on these credit cards has increased sharply.

# Mission 
In a well-developed financial system, risk forecasting is an essential element for the proper functioning of banking establishments. 
To assess the risk, they use financial information, such as company financial statements, customer transaction and reimbursement files, etc.

**My mission is to predict credit card defaults for customers of an international bank** 

# Dataset 

This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

# Work 

My solution for this Data Challenge will take place in 3 phases:

**1. Pre-processing**

  *  [x] Data loading and fixing the missing data problem (Impute data)
  *  [x] A simple statistical study

**2. Model**

  * Prediction modeling
  * Performance evaluation
  * Optimization of hyperameters
  * Choice of the best model
  * Save the model to use it deployement step

**3. Deployment**

  * Mockups design and build a User Interface
  * Conteneurisation using Docker
  * Deploy my docker container on the GCP(Cloud Run)
  
# `RESULTS`

In ***Jupyter Notebook*** I'm trying to explain all the parts of the project as well as the interpretation of each result

The most important thing is to understand the data from a detailed statistical analysis

See you in the Jupyter Notebook
