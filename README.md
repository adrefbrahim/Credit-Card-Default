# Context 
In France and abroad, more and more consumers have become accustomed to using credit cards to make in particular their consumer purchases (supermarket, health expenses ...). 
The main financial institutions have understood this since the competition between them involves in particular the increase in the number of bank card holders associated 
with a revolving line of credit. But with the crisis, the default rate on outstanding loans on these credit cards has increased sharply.

# Mission 
In a well-developed financial system, risk forecasting is an essential element for the proper functioning of banking establishments. 
To assess the risk, they use financial information, such as company financial statements, customer transaction and reimbursement files, etc.

**My mission is to predict credit card defaults for customers of an international bank**
